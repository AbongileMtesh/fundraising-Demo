Absolutely! Here’s a step-by-step guide to share your Streamlit app publicly using GitHub + Streamlit Cloud, the easiest and fastest way:

1️⃣ Prepare your project


Make sure your project folder contains all necessary files, typically:


fundraising_demo/
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt   # lists Python packages used (Streamlit, pandas, etc.)



If you don’t have requirements.txt, create it by running in your project folder:


pip freeze > requirements.txt



Optional: Include a .gitignore to ignore unnecessary files (like .DS_Store or __pycache__).



2️⃣ Push your project to GitHub


Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., fundraising-demo).


Open your terminal in your project folder.


Initialize git if not already:


git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"



Link to GitHub:


git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/fundraising-demo.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

Now your code is on GitHub.

3️⃣ Deploy on Streamlit Cloud


Go to Streamlit Cloud and log in (you can use GitHub to log in).


Click “New App”.


Select your GitHub repository and the branch (usually main).


Specify the file to run (app.py).


Click “Deploy”.




Streamlit will automatically install dependencies from requirements.txt.


After deployment, you’ll get a public URL, e.g.:
https://share.streamlit.io/yourusername/fundraising-demo/main/app.py




4️⃣ Share your app


Copy the URL and share it with your team or anyone publicly.


The app runs entirely in the cloud — no one needs to run anything locally.



✅ Notes / Tips


Free tier apps may sleep after inactivity.


To make changes, push updates to GitHub — Streamlit Cloud automatically redeploys.


Make sure your requirements.txt lists all packages used in app.py (like streamlit and pandas).



If you want, I can also write a clean requirements.txt for your fundraising demo so you can deploy it immediately without errors.
Do you want me to do that?
